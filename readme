Based on the effect, i would likely receive a grade around 'A' or 'A-'. It correctly solves the problem.

Based on your solution, what letter grade would you say you earned?
Based on the criteria of functionality, efficiency, code style, best practices, and scalability, i would likely receive a grade around 'A' or 'A-'. It correctly solves the problem.

Provide a summary of what doesn't work in your solution, along with an explanation of how you attempted to solve the problem and where you feel you struggled.
The C++ program provided addresses the longest common substring problem but with a specific constraint that both input strings must be of equal length, which isn't typically required. It's not optimized for memory usage, as it employs a full 2D matrix, and only outputs one longest common substring when there may be several. Additionally, it doesn't handle edge cases such as empty strings. These limitations suggest the solution is suited for the assignment's specifications but may need adjustments for broader applications.
